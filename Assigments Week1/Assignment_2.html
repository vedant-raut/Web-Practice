      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for </br>
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by </br>
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages </br>
      such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server </br>
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. </br>
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally </br>
      included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the </br>
      building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other </br>
      objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. </br>
      HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting </br>
      structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, </br>
      quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written </br>
      using angle brackets. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting </br>
      language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web </br>
      pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World </br>
      Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current </br>
      maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over </br>
      explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</br>

      <a id="HTML_5">HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting </br>
        content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of </br>
        HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current </br>
        specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a </br>
        consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), </br> 
        the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
        HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major </br> 
        update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve </br>
        the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the </br>
        language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and </br>
        devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain </br>
        backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML </br>
        4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML. HTML5 includes detailed processing models to </br>
        encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the </br>
        markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces </br>
        (APIs) for complex web applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for </br>
        cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered </br>
        devices in mind. Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle </br>
        multimedia and graphical content, the new  elements were added, and support for scalable </br>
        vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas was also added. </br>
        To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as </br>
        and  are added. New attributes were introduced, some elements and attributes were </br>
        removed, and others such as  and  were changed, redefined, or standardized. </br>
        The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the </br>
        HTML5 specification,[6] and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.</a>
